NEEDED FIXES:

1. need to make themes apply everywhere, not just most places. in particular, title bar at the top, most forms and buttons.
2. need to make it work on web again. no idea why it doesn't, for now it only works on android.
3. need to fix the habit counter, sometimes it completes early, before reaching the goal, and doesn't let you go further, etc. it doesn't give or take points either for some reason.
4. due time being set at the end of habits form and journals form not working. for whatever reason the due time seems a bit arbitrary. wondering if it might have to do with the auto-generated test tasks using developer mode, but I doubt it as the problem I think was there before developer mode.
