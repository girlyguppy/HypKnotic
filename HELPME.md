NEEDED FIXES:

1. need to make themes apply everywhere, not just most places. in particular, title bar at the top, some forms and buttons.
2. need to make it work on web again. no idea why it doesn't, for now it only works on android.
3. need to fix the habit counter, sometimes it completes early, before reaching the goal, and doesn't let you go further, etc. it doesn't give or take points either for some reason.
