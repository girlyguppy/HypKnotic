truth is, I don't know what I'm doing. I am copying the functionality and basic purpose of these 2 apps:
https://obedienceapp.com
https://theembraceapp.com

they are 2 linked apps, which work pretty well, but a lot of the good features are locked behind yearly subscriptions. 
you both have to pay for it to get full use of the features. so I decided that I would try to create one that is free and open source.

I don't actually know how to code, I'm just using copilot for now ðŸ’€
