truth is, I don't know what I'm doing. There is a good chance there are incredibly basic things wrong with this project in all aspects.

I am basically copying the functionality and main purpose of these 2 apps:

https://obedienceapp.com
https://theembraceapp.com

they are 2 linked apps, which work pretty well, but a lot of the good features (or even some basic ones) are locked behind yearly subscriptions. can't pay monthly, you have to get a full year.
you both have to pay for it to get full use of the features. so I decided that I would try to create one that is free and open source.

I don't actually know how to code, I'm just using copilot for now ðŸ’€
